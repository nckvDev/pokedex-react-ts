## 📝 Project description
This Pokédex was made in ReactJS + TypeScript. Initially, the application's boilerplate was created using Vite, which has shown itself to be quite performant in front-end applications. We used Syled-components due to the great need to manipulate CSS to generate conditional styles. The Material UI library was also used to create the application's pagination. Finally, all the pokémon data was taken from the API: PokéApi.
